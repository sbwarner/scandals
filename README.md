These files represent the code -- including non-CRAN functions -- used to run the analysis in the main text of "Analyzing Attention to Scandal on Twitter: Elites Sell What Supporters Buy". 

Data should be downloaded directly from the "Who Leads? Who Follows?" repository at: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/AA96D2&version=1.0 (data/main-time-series.csv). For the code to run without adjustment, the dataset should be subset to topics 3, 18, 20, and 88, renamed as the strings "irs", "va", "benghazi", and "nsa", and saved as "timeseries.csv" in your working directory.
